As an Ashland University student in Math 223 (Discrete Mathematics), 
I learned intermediate algorithms to finding the prime factorizations,
greatest common divisors, and least common multiples and thought it
would be useful to implement these algorithms into a program. 
In this program, I make use of my own custom Mathematics module to allow the 
user to easily find GCD's, LCM's, prime factorizations, and convert
a binary number (base 2) to a numeric number (base 10).
